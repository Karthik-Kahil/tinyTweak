      "Optimizing your images with the TinyPNG algorithm brings several benefits to your website. TinyPNG reduces file sizes by up to 80% without sacrificing quality, leading to faster page loads. This optimization is essential for keeping user attention and ensuring an enjoyable user experience. Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth usage, making your website more efficient and cost-effective. Image compression also plays a role in SEO, as efficiently compressed images contribute to faster page speeds and improve your website&apos;s search engine ranking.",
      "Yes, TinyPNG supports WebP images. Our compression feature enables users to achieve the most optimal results when working with WebP files.<br/><br/>WebP, a web image file format created by Google, is supported by major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. This format excels in achieving reduced file sizes while maintaining optimal image quality. Consequently, WebP images are smaller in size compared to PNG and JPEG counterparts, contributing to faster website loading times. This is particularly beneficial for your users, ensuring swift page load times and minimizing bandwidth costs, especially for mobile users.<br/><br/>It’s worth highlighting that despite WebP’s inherent size advantages, Tinify’s optimization can further decrease the file size. The intelligent algorithm ensures that there are no visible differences while more savings are made.",
      "TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!",
      "Currently, Tinify supports WebP, JPG, PNG and APNG (animated PNG).<br/><br/>We are continuously working to expand our portfolio to include additional formats in the future.",
